# Games I Enjoy

Over the years I have enjoyed many video games. One of the first games I ever played was _Super Mario World_ on a _Super Nintendo Enetertainment System_. Later flash games like the ones you would find on _Cool Math Games_, _Friv_, and a lesser known one _Game Gecko_. My favorite game franchise is [_Super Smash Brothers_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros.) created by [_Masahiro Sakurai_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Sakurai), it is a celebration of video games over the years mainly Nintendo but branching out over the years to companies like _Microsoft_ and _Square Enix_, with games like [_Minecraft_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft) and [_Kingdom Hearts_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts).
