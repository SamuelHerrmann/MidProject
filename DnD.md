# Dungeons & Dragons

Throughout my Highschool and College years I have enjoyed playing and running games of Dungeons & Dragons, I started out through my brother Nick's birthday party. Starting out as a ranger, then playing a barbarian with some cousins.

Later down the line my brother introduced me to **_Critical Role_**,a D&D liveshow/podcast on Youtube and Twitch. The show iteself is played and ran by mostly voice actors, the main cast all being voice actors. The Dungeon MAster (the guy who runs the game, npcs, world, almost everything) is Matt Mercer, one of the famous voice actors, he has worked in video games, anime, and animated movies/show. Critical Role both influences how My brother and I run games. Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/criticalrole) to check out their Youtube channel.
