# Scouting

Ever since 1st grade I have been involved with scouting, sepcifically _Cub Scouts_ and _Boy Scouts_. I am currently an _Eagle Scout_ the highest rank in scouting. I am also in the _Order of the Arrow_, an honors group in Scouting. I assisted with Scouting for Food, an orgaization that collects food for those in need. I attened 2 _High Adeventure_ camps, Philmont in New Mexico and Seabase in Florida. Loads of fun, had to hike for a week straight in Philmont, and live on an island in Sea base that was about 15 miles from shore. Loads of fun and pain! But scouting did teach me how to use a map and other basic survival skills so that good.
